## Running the app

### Running Locally
To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`
  * Also make sure your db is running `sudo service postgresql start`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
